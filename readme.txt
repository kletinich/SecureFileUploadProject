How to operate the program:
1. make sure the server has port.info file. if not the default port will be used.
2. make sure the client has transfer.info file. if not the client can't run
3. for the sake of testing, the server and the client work in batch mode - everything is automatic,
	 so make sure the file 'test.txt' is present. this file is used and transimted to the server.
4. Open and run the server
5. Open and run the client
6. Make sure to close the server manually if you want to finish the testing. 
7. Make sure not to delete any created info file for the program to run without crashing
